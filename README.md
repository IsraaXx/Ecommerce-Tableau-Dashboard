## About the Project

This is my very first attempt at building a data visualization dashboard using Tableau. The dataset was sourced from [Kaggle - Ecommerce Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/carrie1/ecommerce-data), and the goal was to explore key ecommerce insights and visualize customer and sales behaviors.

While this was my initial try, the experience taught me a lot about interactive dashboards and common data issues, which helped me improve in future projects.
